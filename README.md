# AoC-2024 ðŸŽ„

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a set of 25 problems throughout the month of December until Christmas.\
I have set out all my solutions to the Advent of Code, written in Python, with comments explaining each section of it within folders named after their respective day.\
The folders contain the solution in `solution.py` without the input texts. \
This repo only uses [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), however [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) is only used to set up each day's inputs.
